Data Analysis with Python and Pandas

Data analysis is a growing topic in business and education these days. In this workshop we introduce data analysis using Python and Pandas. Our goal is to show how easy it is to get started with data analysis and to create interest for further learning.

Topics include importing your data from spreadsheets, databases and csv files, cleaning up data and bad values, investigating and analysing data, making calculations based on our data, and producing tables and graphs from our analysis.

The Python programming language and Pandas data analysis library are free, open-source tools. Python is quickly becoming the favorite programming language for data scientists and begginers, and Pandas is one of the reasons why.

Join us and learn how easy it is to analyse and graph your own data using Python and Pandas.
